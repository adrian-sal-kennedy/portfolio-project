## Rationale
A decent personal brand needs a decent personal website. This site may one day become that for me.  

I've included some film industry work mainly for interest - though I'm fairly well quit with freelance film, my interests and aptitude are still very much tied to it and I have a wealth of tools I've developed over the years that I would really love to start doing justice on and releasing to the world (sometimes for a fee, mostly not).  

I'm definitely going to build the blog feature much further as time goes on. I would ideally like to have some server-side stuff that watches a folder for markdown files and injects them into the page. Markdown is much easier to blog in than html. I'll be putting all kinds of geeky explorations up there. Right now it's just got some book quotes.

## Walkthrough video:

- basic walkthrough of function
- design approach
- responsive portrait/landscape demo
- wireframe (balsamiq)
- trello
- mood board (pinterest)

For the forseeable next few hours, the above video will serve as a lot of my slide deck, as pulling screenshots from it will take time that I don't have right now. I hope it's entertaining enough though.
