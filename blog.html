          Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
        </p><p class="p">
          Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
        </p><p class="p">
          This planet has—or rather had—a problem, which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn’t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
        </p><p class="p">
          And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.
        </p><p class="p">
          Many were increasingly of the opinion that they’d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.

          It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
        </p><p class="p">
          However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.

          “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”
        </p><p class="p">
          Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
        </p><p class="p">
          “But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.”
        </p><p class="p">
          Mr. Bennet made no answer.
        </p><p class="p">
          “Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.
        </p><p class="p">
          “You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”
        </p><p class="p">
          This was invitation enough.
        </p><p class="p">
          “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.”
        </p><p class="p"> “What is his name?”
        </p><p class="p">“Bingley.”
        </p><p class="p">“Is he married or single?”
        </p><p class="p">“Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”
        </p><p class="p">“How so? How can it affect them?”
        </p><p class="p">“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”</p>
